# **(9.5/10)**
# Strong aspects
1. I especially liked Property 16.
2. The assumptions of the threat models are adequately described.

# Areas of improvement
1. (**-0.5**) The threat models should describe which security properties will be affected and in what ways when each of the assumptions gets violated.


# General comments
1. Some properties (e.g., Property 9) are not **security** properties.
